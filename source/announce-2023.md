#### 10 March 2023 - Apache Struts version 6.1.2 General Availability {#a20230310}

The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Apache Struts version 6.1.2 is available as a "General Availability"
release. The GA designation is our highest quality grade.

The Apache Struts is an elegant, extensible framework for creating enterprise-ready Java web applications.
The framework has been designed to streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying,
to maintaining applications over time.

Below is a full list of all changes:

**Improvement**

- WW-5285 - Upgrade commons-fileupload to ver 1.5 and add option to limit number of accepted files

> Please read the [Version Notes]({{ site.wiki_url }}/Version+Notes+6.1.2) to find more details about performed
> bug fixes and improvements. Also, a dedicated [migration guide]({{ site.wiki_url }}/Struts+2.5+to+6.0.0+migration) 
> has been prepared.

**All developers are strongly advised to perform this upgrade.**

The 6.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minimum requirement of the following specification versions:
Servlet API 3.1, JSP API 2.1, and Java 8.

Should any issues arise with your use of any version of the Struts framework, please post your comments to the user list,
and, if appropriate, file [a tracking ticket]({{ site.jira_url }}).

You can download this version from our [download](download.cgi#struts-ga) page.
